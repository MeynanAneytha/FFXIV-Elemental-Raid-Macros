# The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate)

Since Elemental PF hasn't agreed on a TEA strat since Patch 5.1, I'm going to take the liberty of piecing one together myself. This is what I would do:

- [**Living Liquid**](en/01_living_liquid.md): Modified Separations (the "JP strat")
- [**Limit Cut**](en/02a_limit_cut.md): 1211 or 1256
- [**Brute Justice + Cruise Chaser**](en/02b_bjcc.md): Tollgate (this is my strat that I use)
- [**Alexander Prime**](en/03_alex_prime.md): 09STOP Wormhole (Korean sim strat- this is also called "Onyxia" by NA/EU)
- [**Perfect Alexander**](en/04_perfect_alex.md)

### PoVs

- [MT PoV (WAR)](https://youtu.be/uJVHsrhHsJ8)
- [ST PoV (PLD)](https://youtu.be/leQ9t61W4OY)
- [H1 PoV (WHM)](https://youtu.be/IqcxKunPY5Q)
- [H2 PoV (SGE)](https://youtu.be/Q80yoHMcxhg)
- [D1 PoV (SAM)](https://youtu.be/RCkbxPT3prI)
- [D2 PoV (NIN)](https://youtu.be/yb9oLIlwiCM)
- [D3 PoV (DNC)](https://youtu.be/ToaYJdOdUcA)
- [D4 PoV (RDM)](https://youtu.be/coE2xYyd23A)

### Things to check

- The Esuna priority for Living Liquid's Throttles (Esuna self first or not)
- The Limit Cut strategy (1211 vs. 1256)
- The Exatrine positions (center vs. SW marker)

### BiS Notes

- Any gear at or above **i595** will have their substats capped.
- Relic weapons will have their substats capped at **184**.
- The lowest potions you can use and still get maximum benefits are **HQ Grade 6 Tinctures**.

## Markers

- `ABCD` are for orientation

**Limit Cut:**
- `1234` divides the arena for Limit Cut
    - If doing 1211, start from the first explosion on the non-marked side.
    - If doing 1256, the 1256 group goes to the side without markers. The 3478 group goes to the side with markers.

**Brute Justice + Cruise Chaser:**
- `A`: 1st Water
- `C`: 2nd Water
- `3`: 3rd Water

**Alexander Prime:**
- `4`: Party stack for Inception Formation (except for ST, healers, and blue-tether DPS)

**Perfect Alexander:**
- `B`: Dark Beacon (Forced March, Fate Calibration Beta)
- `1234`: Exatrine
