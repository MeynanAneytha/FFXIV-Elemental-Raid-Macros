# The Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate)

PF largely follows [Clees' UWU guide](https://www.icy-veins.com/ffxiv/the-weapons-refrain-ultimate-guides-ultima) with a few differences:

- Ultima is pulled a little **north** after Ultimate Predation instead of south. Eruption baiters will start **south** instead of north.
- Green orbs during Ultimate Annihilation are taken **2211** instead of 3311.

The various phases can be broken down as follows:

- [**Garuda**](en/01_garuda.md): Midruda
- [**Ifrit**](en/02_ifrit.md): Reverse-Z
- [**Titan**](en/03_titan.md): Mario Kart
- [**Ultimate Predation**](en/04_predation.md)
- [**Ultimate Annihilation**](en/05_annihilation.md): 2211 orbs
- [**Ultimate Suppression**](en/06_suppression.md): Fan Suppression
- [**Primal Roulette**](en/07_primal_roulette.md)

### BiS Notes

- Any gear at or above **i500** will have their substats capped.
- Relic weapons will have their substats capped at **136**.
- The lowest potions you can use and still get maximum benefits are **HQ Grade 4 Tinctures**.

## Things to note

- There are edge cases to consider if you have a PLD or GNB and skipping Ifrit dashes are a possibility.
    - If you **skip** Ifrit dashes, there is about **6:30** between Ifrit's *first* set of Incinerates and the Homing Lasers after Ultimate Predation (PLD cannot invuln both).
    - If you **don't skip** Ifrit's dashes, there is about **5:40** between Ifrit's *second* set of Incinerates and the Homing Lasers after Ultimate Predation (GNB and PLD cannot invuln both).
- You can fix the tank invuln sequence in Ultima by choosing to tank swap Ifrit's second set of Incinerates instead of using the MT invuln there (although this isn't usually practiced).

## Waking the Primals

The defining characteristic of the first three phases (Garuda, Ifrit, Titan) is that each of the bosses must be "woken" by the party.

By executing a mechanic in a particular (generally harder) manner, the boss will get one stack of "Aetherically Charged".

When a boss gets four stacks of "Aetherically Charged", they become "Woken", which does the following:

* Certain attacks are changed or modified when the boss is woken.
* When defeated, a woken boss will leave behind a light puddle that will give a player a "Beyond Limits" buff when stepped on.
* When a player with "Beyond Limits" uses an LB3, the buff will be consumed and the LB gauge refilled to LB3.
* A caster, a healer, and a melee **must** have this buff to clear the transition to Ultima Weapon.
