## Waking Garuda

"Thermal Low" is a debuff that is applied on a player as a result of certain mechanics:

1. Spiny Plume's tankbuster (Cyclone)
2. Garuda's Friction

These stacks are then cleansed in two places:

1. Entering a bubble left behind when the Spiny Plume is destroyed.
2. Taking Mesohigh tethers from Chirada and Suparna ("the sisters").

When a player's Thermal Low stacks are cleansed, the party will take raid-wide damage depending on the number of stacks cleansed:

- If **one** stack is cleansed, the party takes minor damage.
- If **two** stacks are cleansed, the party takes a lot of damage.
- If **three** or more stacks are cleansed, the party takes lethal damage.

**Garuda gains a stack of "Aetherically Charged" when a player cleanses at least two stacks of Thermal Low.**

The following mechanics will also change when Garuda is woken:

## Spiny Plume

  </tr>

## Friction

This is the major mechanic in Garuda, and is where the party will set Garuda up to be woken later on. Note that unlike Ifrit and Titan, Garuda will not *actually* be awoken after this mechanic, but we will do most of the legwork here.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>8.</b> After the Spiny Plume hits the ST for a second time (giving them a second stack of Thermal Low), destroy it. This will cause the Spiny Plume to explode in a telegraphed AoE, leaving behind a bubble.</p><p>The later the Spiny Plume is destroyed, the more time the party has to execute the upcoming mechanics. However, destroying the Spiny Plume too late will give the ST a third stack of Thermal Low, which will wipe the raid.</p></td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>9.</b> Stack near the edge of the bubble:<ul><li><b>Inside:</b> MT, ST, H1, H2, D3, D4</li><li><b>Outside:</b> D1, D2</li></ul></p><p>When the ST enters the bubble, their Thermal Low stacks will be cleansed, dealing raid-wide damage, and giving Garuda her first stack of Aetherically Charged.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/garuda/garuda_09.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>10.</b> The ST joins D1 and D2 outside the bubble.</p><p>Garuda will cast Friction on a random player. This will give all players that are hit one stack of Thermal Low; the players inside the bubble will have their stack immediately cleansed.</p><p><em>(Only the ST, D1, and D2 should now have 1 stack of Thermal Low.)</em></p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/garuda/garuda_10.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>11.</b> Everybody exit the bubble and stack together outside.</p><p>Garuda will cast a second Friction on a random player, giving all players a stack of Thermal Low.</p><p><em>(All players should have one stack of Thermal Low except the ST, D1, and D2 who have two stacks each.)</em></p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/garuda/garuda_11.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>12.</b> Have D1 enter the bubble, cleansing their Thermal Low stacks.</p><p>This will give Garuda her second stack of Aetherically Charged.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/garuda/garuda_12.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>13.</b> Heal up, then D2 enters the bubble, cleansing their Thermal Low stacks.</p><p>This will give Garuda her third stack of Aetherically Charged.</p><p><em>(MT, H1, H2, D3, D4 should each have one stack of Thermal Low, and the ST should have two stacks.)</em></p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/garuda/garuda_13.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>14.</b> Garuda will jump (and shriek), placing Feather Rain puddles on random players.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/garuda/garuda_14.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Note that Garuda only has three of the four stacks needed to wake her.

## Midruda

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>15.</b> Garuda lands and starts casting Aerial Blast. After that, she then summons Chirada and Suparna (the "sisters").</p><p>They follow the same rules as Garuda- they will jump with a shriek, and Feather Rains will drop on five random players when that happens.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/garuda/garuda_15.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>16.</b> Stack together south to bait Feather Rains for when Chirada and Suparna jump.</p><p>Try to keep Garuda in the middle <em>(hence the name "Midruda")</em>.</p><p>When the sisters shriek, dodge Feather Rains and move to stack South-East.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/garuda/garuda_16.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>17.</b> Chirada and Suparna will spawn outside the arena on two of the four cardinal directions and target two random (non tanks) with Mistral Song.</p><p>The two tanks need to intercept this attach just like what the ST did at the very start of the fight.</p><p>Keep Garuda in the middle until her telegraphed AoE appears before going to intercept the two sisters' Mistral Songs.</p><ul><li><b>MT:</b> Take the first sister starting North (inclusive) and going anti-clockwise (N > W > S).</li><li><b>ST:</b> Take the first sister starting East (inclusive) and going clockwise (E > S > W).</li></ul></td>
    <td><img src="../images/garuda/garuda_17.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>18.</b>The two sisters will them jump (dodge Feather Rains), and two green tornado AoEs will spawn where the MT and ST were.</p><p>Done correctly, the center of the arena will <em>always</em> be safe.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/garuda/garuda_18.jpg"></td>
  </tr>

## Waking Garuda

This is the last part of Garuda's phase, and is where the party will give Garuda the fourth stack of Aetherically Charged, waking her.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>19.</b> Four Satin Plumes spawn and tether themselves to random players. Destroy these.</p><p>Chirada and Suparna return on the East and West of the arena and tether two random players with a green Mesohigh tether.</p><p><ul><li><b>ST:</b> Take the West tether away from the party.</li><li><b>D4:</b> Take the East tether away from the party.</li><li><b>MT:</b> Bait another Slipstream away from the party.</li></ul></p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/garuda/garuda_19.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>20.</b> The MT returns to the front to bait a Downburst (frontal cleave), while the ST and D4 have their stacks cleansed by the Mesohigh tethers.</p><p><ul><li><b>MT:</b> There is a <em>lot</em> of damage going out even though there isn't an explicit tankbuster. Use cooldowns.</li></ul></p><p>This will cleanse the two stacks of Thermal Low on the ST, giving Garuda her fourth stack of Aetherically Charged, and waking her with a "HOWL TEMPEST! NONE SHALL ESCAPE MY WRATH!"</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/garuda/garuda_20.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>21.</b> The sisters will then jump (and shriek), so bait and dodge Feather Rains again.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/garuda/garuda_21.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>22.</b> MT baits a Slipstream away from the party.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/garuda/garuda_22.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>23.</b> Garuda will then cast another Wicked Wheel (point-blank AoE).</p><p><b>However</b>, because Garuda is now awake, there will be a second donut AoE (Wicked Tornado) immediately after Wicked Wheel's telegraphed hit that has no telegraph or cast time.</p><p>Simply dodge into Wicked Wheel's AoE as soon as it resolves to avoid the Wicked Tornado.</p><p><em>(Most groups will have killed Garuda by this point.)</em></p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/garuda/garuda_23.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>24.</b> Garuda then does a (Woken) Downburst on the MT.</p><p>Since Garuda is now awake, this Downburst is now split amonst the entire party.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/garuda/garuda_24.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>25.</b> The MT then goes in front again to bait one more Slipstream away from the party.</p><p>After this, Garuda will jump (Feather Rains), become untargetable and enrage (Aerial Blast).</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/garuda/garuda_25.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

When a woken Garuda is defeated, a light puddle will appear under her. When a player steps into this puddle, they will receive the "Beyond Limits" buff.

<table>
  <tr><td><b>Beyond Limits (Garuda)</b></td><td>Healer</td></tr>
</table>

When a player with the Beyond Limit buff uses an LB3, the buff will then refill the LB gauge. This will be relevant in the transition to Ultima Weapon.

The MT, H1, H2, and D3 should each have one stack of Thermal Low. These will be relevant much later into the fight (from Ultimate Annihilation onwards).

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>26.</b> Ifrit will spawn on one of the four cardinal directions, and will charge through the arena.</p><p>The entire floor will also be covered in Eruptions, with <b>one</b> safe spot 90 degrees from where Ifrit spawns.</p><p><em>(The timing is quite tight- Sprint is highly recommended.)</em></p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/garuda/garuda_26.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
