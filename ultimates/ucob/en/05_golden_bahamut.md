# Golden Bahamut

This phase is often nicknamed the "victory lap" because it's the simplest phase in the entire fight.

The final phase of UCoB consists of three mechanics on a loop:

1. Morn Afah (party stack)
2. Akh Morn (shared tankbuster)
3. Exaflares

This loop repeats five times in total.

**However**, the order for Morn Afah and Akh Morn is switched **only for the second iteration.**

## Mitigations

This phase requires planning out and coordinating mitigations. The recommended base mitigation is:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Morn Afah #1</b></td>
    <td><p>MT 90s, ST Reprisal, H2 shields, H2 30s, D1, D4</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Morn Afah #2</b></td>
    <td>ST 90s, MT Reprisal, H2 shields, H2 30s, D3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Morn Afah #3</b></td>
    <td>MT 90s, ST Reprisal, D1, D4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Morn Afah #4</b></td>
    <td>MT Reprisal, ST 90s, D2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Morn Afah #5</b></td>
    <td>MT 90s, ST Reprisal, D3, D4</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Some things to consider:

- DRK is the only tank *without* a 90s party mitigation at Level 70.
- AST has an extra cooldown you can use to help shore up missing mitigation.
- Golden Bahamut's DPS check is (very) lenient now. Consider Tank LB to help mitigate Morn Afah if anything goes wrong.

Tanks will also need to plan out their cooldowns for the Akh Morns.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Akh Morn #1</b></td>
    <td><p>MT + ST stack, Rampart + 120s (whatever's available)</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Akh Morn #2</b></td>
    <td>MT invuln</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Akh Morn #3</b></td>
    <td>ST invuln</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Akh Morn #4</b></td>
    <td>MT + ST stack, Rampart + 120s</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>1.</b> Golden Bahamut targets a random party member with Morn Afah.</p><p>This is a full 8-man party stack that requires additional mitigation.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_golden_bahamut/golden_bahamut_01.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>2.</b> Golden Bahamut then targets the tank for Akh Morn.</p><p>This should be stacked and shared between the two tanks.</p><p>For this first Akh Morn, the <b>tanks stack where the south Neurolink was</b>.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_golden_bahamut/golden_bahamut_02.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>3.</b> Golden Bahamut casts Exaflare.</p><p>First set of Exaflares appear.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_golden_bahamut/golden_bahamut_03.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>4.</b> Second set of Exaflares appear.</p><p>If possible, try to get a 3-to-1 dodge <em>(a 3-to-1 dodge may not always be available)</em>.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_golden_bahamut/golden_bahamut_04.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>5.</b> Third set of Exaflares appear.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_golden_bahamut/golden_bahamut_05.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>6.</b> Golden Bahamut casts Akh Morn on the MT.</p><p>Note that the party stays <b>at the edge</b>, while the tank(s) <b>are towards the center</b>.</p><p><em>This will be Morn Afah in all future iterations.</em></p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_golden_bahamut/golden_bahamut_06.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>7.</b> Golden Bahamut then targets a random (non-tank) player with Morn Afah.</p><p><em>This will be Akh Morn in all future iterations.</em></p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_golden_bahamut/golden_bahamut_07.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

The above loop repeats four more times before Goldan Bahamut casts a final Morn Afah, targeting players one at a time (in order of descending hate) to serve as the hard enrage.
