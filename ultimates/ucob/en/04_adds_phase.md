# Twintania + Nael deus Darnus

Commonly referred to as the "adds phase", this phase can be intimidating at first, but it's actually **less** chaotic compared to Nael's phase near the start of the fight.

This phase is essentially a loop repeated twice:

1. Plummet/Bahamut's Claw
2. Liquid Hell
3. Hatches → Twisters
4. Nael's line → Twisters
5. Megaflare → Death Sentence/Ravensbeak *(this swaps order on the second loop)*

There are four possible quotes Nael will use in this phase. Note that the first mechanic will always be either Lunar Dynamo, or Iron Chariot.

This is important, because Nael will always start with the opposite mechanic in the second loop.

Nael's lines will include a combination of Lunar Dynamo, Iron Chariot, Raven's Dive, and Thermionic Beam.

Note that because Nael is at the edge of the arena, ranged players can outrange the Lunar Dynamo.

The loop then repeats from Plummet/Bahamut's Claw.

The second loop has the following differences from the first:

- If Nael started with Lunar Dynamo the first time around, she will start with Iron Chariot in the second iteration (and vice-versa).
- Megaflare comes before the tank swap in the first loop, but the tank swap comes first in the second loop.

Twintania and Nael must be killed at the same time. If either one of them dies, the other casts Twin Fury/White Fury- a 3-second cast that refills their HP to full.

To help with this, caster LB or ranged LB when both their HP is low.
