# Twintania

## Part 1: 100% HP - 75% HP

Twintania's first phase is a basic introduction to what to expect- Twisters, and the Fireball stack. The phase lasts until Twintania is pushed below 75% HP.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>1.</b> Pull Twintania over the NW marker, and point it away from the party so Plummet doesn't hit anyone else.</p><p>Have the rest of the party spread out, but make sure all party members (except for the tanks) have a clear path to Twintania's rear.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/01_twintania/twintania_1_1.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>2.</b> Twintania will mark one random (non-tank) player with a Fireball marker, and cast Twister.</p><p>All players will bait Twisters where they stand.</p><p>While doing so, all players except the tanks and D3 moves to stack together behind Twintania to split Fireball's damage in a 5-man stack.</p><ul><li><b>D3: </b> Stay out of the Fireball stack unless you are the Fireball target.</li><li><b>D4: </b>Join the Fireball stack unless D3 is the Fireball target.</li></ul><p>You will need to mitigate this Fireball to survive- use effects like shields, Sacred Soil/Kerachole and Troubadour/Tactician/Shield Samba.</p><p><b>Do not</b> use debuffs like Reprisal, Feint, or Addle.</p></td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>3.</b> Twintania then uses Death Sentence, a single-target tankbuster that also applies a slashing damage debuff, thus mandating a tank swap. The loop then repeats from Plummet (with the MT and ST swapped).</p><p><em>(Most groups will push Twintania into the next phase without seeing the second Fireball.)</em></p></td>

  </tr>
</table>

## Part 2: 74% HP - 45% HP

This second phase builds upon the mechanics introduced in the first, adding Liquid Hell and Hatches to the mix.

The phase ends when Twintania is pushed below 45% HP.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>6.</b> Twintania casts Generate, which marks a random DPS. A black orb will spawn under Twintania and move towards the marked player.</p><p>All players should keep clear of the area between Twintania and the Neurolink to avoid getting hit by the black orb.</p></td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>7. </b>The marked player must get hit with the black orb while inside the Neurolink that Twintania left behind earlier, or wipe the raid. </p><p>The orb will also explode in an AoE around it, so make sure other players don't get hit.</p><p>It also puts a Mana Hypersensitivity debuff which means that player cannot be hit by a second orb- this does not do anything for now.</p><p>Meanwhile, Twintania will begin another round of five baited Liquid Hells.</p><ul><li><b>D3:</b> Bait the Liquid Hells.</li><li><b>H2 or D4:</b> In the event D3 is targeted with Hatch, take over and bait this set of Liquid Hell instead.</li></ul></td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>8. </b>Twintania then does another Death Sentence on the current target.</p><ul><li><b>MT, ST:</b> Tank swap.</li></ul></td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>10. </b>Twintania then casts Twister.</p><p>All players move to dodge Twister. The DPS targeted with Hatch baits their Twister outside the Neurolink first, before then entering the Neurolink to resolve Hatch.</p><p><em>(If party DPS is high, you may skip this set of Twisters. The DPS with Hatch should watch Twintania's HP to check whether the Twisters are skipped.)</em></p></td>

## Part 3: 44% HP - 0% HP

This phase is the culmination of all the mechanics introduced thus far.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Fireballs]</b> Why do only 5 people stack for the Fireballs at the start of the fight?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>This is to help build LB.</p><p>To make the transition from Nael to Bahamut, there must be at least a tank LB2 to keep the party alive. However, as the DPS check has gotten easier over time, there's a chance that insufficient LB will be built if the whole party split the Fireball damage.</p><p>The Fireball stacks in the last phase are resolved with the full party as it's not worth wiping the party to insufficient players/mitigations unless the healers know what they are doing.</p></td></tr>
</table>
</details>
<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Fireballs]</b> Why does D3 stay out of the initial Fireball stack, instead of D4 who would have to cast and move?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>This is done to keep D3's HP high as they will be baiting Liquid Hell shortly after.</p></td></tr>
</table>
</details>
<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Fireballs]</b> Why wasn't LB generated with the Fireball? Why don't we debuff Twintania with Reprisal/Feint/Addle?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>LB is built if someone in the party takes lethal damage, but is saved by shields and mitigations.</p><p>By splitting the Fireball damage between just five players instead of eight, we intentionally "kill" the five players, but save them through shields and mitigations, thus building LB.</p><p>It's important to note that the <b>incoming</b> damage (before party mitigations are applied) must be lethal to the party- avoid debuffing Twintania (Reprisal, Feint, Addle), as this lowers the <b>outgoing</b> damage (<em>before</em> party mitigations are applied) instead, making it not lethal to the players.</p></td></tr>
</table>
</details>
<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Hatch + Liquid Hell]</b> The orb takes too long to get to me and I end up standing in a fire puddle and dying. What's wrong?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>The orbs start moving towards the players before Twintania starts the Liquid Hells. During this time, the orbs are supposed to reach the players inside the Neurolinks.</p><p>If they are taking too long, either the targeted players are curving the orbs too much (increasing their travel distance), or the Neurolinks are too far from Twintania (the markers are placed too far apart).</p></td></tr>
