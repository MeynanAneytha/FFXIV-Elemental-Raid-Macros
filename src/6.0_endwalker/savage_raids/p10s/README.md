# Anabaseios: The Tenth Circle (Savage)

[Game8](https://game8.jp/ff14/532718) has gone with the FFO strat.

The FFO strat is Inumaru's strat with two adjustments:

1. The first set of Dæmoniac Bonds use just the west-side island.
2. The turret order is different.
  - Inumaru: (**melee** + tank) → (**healer** + ranged) → (**healer** + tank) → tank
  - FFO: (**healer** + tank) → (**ranged** + tank) → (**melee** + tank) → tank
