# Mount Ordeals (Extreme)

There are currently two main strats that are going around- the FFO strat, and Nukemaru's strat (which Game8 has also adopted).

Both strats are identical, *except* for how Flamerake is handled and where the party stacks during Sweeping Immolation.

## FFO strat

The following is the FFO macro for Rubicante EX. It's the macro that best approximates what *actually* gets done in PF, and is the one I would like to use.

### Japanese

```
{% include_relative macros/rubicante_ffo.jp.txt %}
```

### English

```
{% include_relative macros/rubicante_ffo.en.txt %}
```

### Flamerake (FFO)

The FFO strat places emphasis on the (true-north) spread positions to match all other spreads in the fight.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>1.</b> Players take up their (true-north) spread positions, and watch the spinner in the middle.</p>
    <p><em>(In this example, tanks/healers have the Flare markers)</em></p></td>
    <td><img src="images/flamerake_ffo_1_1.jpg"></td>
    <td><img src="images/flamerake_ffo_2_1.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>2.</b> The group that the spinners pointed to rotates clockwise.</p></td>
    <td><img src="images/flamerake_ffo_1_2.jpg"></td>
    <td><img src="images/flamerake_ffo_2_2.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>3.</b> The Flare players dodge into the first set of AoEs.</p><p>Dodge either to your spread position, <em>or</em> clockwise from your spread position.</p></td>
    <td><img src="images/flamerake_ffo_1_3.jpg"></td>
    <td><img src="images/flamerake_ffo_2_3.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>4.</b> Spread according to your (true-north) spread positions.</p></td>
    <td><img src="images/flamerake_ffo_1_4.jpg"></td>
    <td><img src="images/flamerake_ffo_2_4.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Game 8/Nukemaru's strat

These macros are from [Game8](https://game8.jp/ff14/507079) which follows Nukemaru's strat.

{% include youtube.html id="uWR-SoZ4hFw" %}

### Japanese

```
{% include_relative macros/rubicante_g8.jp.txt %}
```

### English

```
{% include_relative macros/rubicante_g8.en.txt %}
```

### Flamerake (Game8/Nukemaru)

With Nukemaru's strat, players that need to rotate always rotates clockwise. The final spread positions are not the true-north spread positions, but are in whatever orientation the party ends up in at the end of Flamerake.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>1.</b> Players stand in pairs at the cardinal positions.</p>
    <p><em>(In this example, tanks/healers have the Flare markers)</em></p></td>
    <td><img src="images/flamerake_nukemaru_1_1.jpg"></td>
    <td><img src="images/flamerake_nukemaru_2_1.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>2.</b> If the spinner ends up pointing at you, rotate clockwise.</p></td>
    <td><img src="images/flamerake_nukemaru_1_2.jpg"></td>
    <td><img src="images/flamerake_nukemaru_2_2.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>3.</b> The Flare players rotate clockwise into the first set of AoEs.</p></td>
    <td><img src="images/flamerake_nukemaru_1_3.jpg"></td>
    <td><img src="images/flamerake_nukemaru_2_3.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>4.</b> Flare players step in, while the stack players step out and spread according to your current positions (depending on how many times you had to rotate).</p></td>
    <td><img src="images/flamerake_nukemaru_1_4.jpg"></td>
    <td><img src="images/flamerake_nukemaru_2_4.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Markers

- The markers are the spread positions during Flamerake and Scalding Ring/Signal.
