# FFXIV Elemental Raid Macros

This repository is a collection of macros (and my notes) often encountered in the Elemental Data Center (DC).

Because Elemental is ultimately a Japanese DC, these macros are for **Japanese** PF strategies. Keep that in mind that when watching (English) videos/reading guides- the strategies used may have some differences from the ones here.

Of course, there will probably be small differences between the macros here and the ones you may encounter in PF- use the ones here as a base to work with.
