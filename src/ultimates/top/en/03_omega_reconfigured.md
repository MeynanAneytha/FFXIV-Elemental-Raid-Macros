# Omega Reconfigured

This is the only phase in the fight with a transitional mechanic.

## Hello, World

Although Hello, World may look overwhelming at first, there are really just two variations, determined by which colour debuff (Critical Performance and Critical Underflow) get paired with Critical Overflow and Critical Synchronization.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><img src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/hello_world_0_0a.jpg"></td>
    <td><img src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/hello_world_0_0b.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><em>"Blue is Defamation"</em></p>
      <p>Critical Overflow <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/critical_overflow_bug.png"> has Critical Performance <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/critical_performance_bug.png"></p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <p><em>"Red is Defamation"</em></p>
      <p>Critical Overflow <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/critical_overflow_bug.png"> has Critical Underflow <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/critical_underflow_bug.png"></p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

After that, Hello, World is simply a cycle of debuffs to resolve. At any one point, two players will be at each stage in the cycle.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><p>The basic loop consists of:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Orientate to coloured towers.</li>
      <li>Pair players together:
        <ul>
          <li>Critical Overflows <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/critical_overflow_bug.png"> pair with Local Regression <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/local_regression.png"> (red/green tethers).</li>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Critical Overflows <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/critical_overflow_bug.png"> and Critical Synchronizations <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/critical_synchronization_bug.png"> resolve.</li>
      <li>Pass Critical Underflow <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/critical_underflow_bug.png"> (red Nisi) and Critical Performance <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/critical_performance_bug.png"> (blue Nisi). Break Remote Regression <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/remote_regression.png"> (blue tethers).</li>
      <li>Break Local Regression <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/local_regression.png"> (red/green tethers).</li>
      <li>Repeat the loop with the next mechanic in the cycle.<ul><em>If you just took a tower, you will swap sides/colours for the next iteration.</em></ul></li>
    </ol></td>
    <td><img src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/hello_world_cycle.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

This loop is repeated four times (so all players will have their go at each debuff), although the final iteration has one small difference where the Local Regression players stand away from the Critical Overflows instead.

### First iteration

For brevity's sake, we will only display the relevant debuffs from here onwards.

<div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<p><b>Tip:</b> The boss will still be auto-attacking the tanks during Hello, World.</p><p>These should be mitigated by cycling through your cooldowns to help reduce strain on the healers. Tank swap after the second set of towers to cycle through the ST's mitigations.</p></div>
<div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<p><b>Tip:</b> The party will be taking raid-wide damage from Critical Overflow, Critical Synchronization, and the two tethers. Three mitigations (including shields) are needed for non-tanks to survive all the damage without any additional healing.</p><p>Boss debuffs (Reprisal, Dismantle, Feint, Addle) are particularly handy because having all players in range can be tricky.</p></div>

## Fourth iteration

All players rotate their roles again for the fourth (and final) iteration.

- Players who were Critical Overflow <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/critical_overflow_bug.png"> become Remote Regression <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/remote_regression.png"> (blue tethers)
- Players who were Remote Regression <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/remote_regression.png"> become Critical Synchronization <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/critical_synchronization_bug.png">
- Players who were Critical Synchronization <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/critical_synchronization_bug.png"> become Local Regression <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/local_regression.png"> (red/green tethers)
- Players who were Local Regression <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/local_regression.png"> become Critical Overflow <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/critical_overflow_bug.png">.

This time around, there are two differences:

1. Red/green tethers will **join** the blue tethers at Critical Synchronizations <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/critical_synchronization_bug.png"> instead of getting hit by Critical Overflow <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/critical_overflow_bug.png"> and break **first**.
2. Players will **not** pass Critical Underflow <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/critical_underflow_bug.png"> and Critical Performance <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/critical_performance_bug.png">.

## Oversampled Wave Cannon

Omega then brings back its "monitors" mechanic from O12S-2, with the added twist that three random players *also* get their own set of monitors to resolve.

With four monitors in total (Omega and three players) and each monitor hitting two players, the party needs to arrange themselves such that all players will take exactly one monitor hit each.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Local Regression]</b> Why do the Local Regression players not stand with the Critical Overflows in the final iteration?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>Omega casts "Critical Error" at the end of Hello, World.</p><p>This will apply a new Critical Overflow Bug onto <em>all</em> players. However, because all players have the Critical Overflow Debugger buff, this additional Critical Overflow Bug is blocked.</p><p>If the Local Regression players stayed with the Critical Overflow players in the final iteration, their Critical Overflow Debugger buffs would get consumed there instead.</p><p>As as result, they won't have the Critical Overflow Debugger buff when Omega casts Critical Error, and will get another round of Critical Overflows that will last into Oversampled Wave Cannon.</p></td></tr>
</table>
</details>
<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Oversampled Wave Cannon]</b> Why are the healers north-most? Doesn't putting healers south-most guarantee the southern spot goes to a ranged?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>Putting all four ranged players south <em>guarantees</em> that the southern player is a ranged, thus providing full melee uptime even in the scenario where all three monitor players are ranged, but the chances of this happening are 1/14.</p><p>Putting healers at the north side means that both extremeties will have ranged players in the average case, which allows them to go all the way to the edge of the arena to give the other players more room for error, the north-most monitor player in particular.</p><p>That being said, doing so means that a melee may have to disconnect from the boss in the worst case scenario, but this is an acceptable scenario given its likelihood.</p></td></tr>

## Troubleshooting

<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Cascading Latent Defect/Latent Performance Defect]</b> Why did we wipe to this even though we took the towers correctly?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>Someone picked up Critical Performance Bug (the blue Nisi) or Critical Underflow Bug (the red Nisi) too late.</p><p>Taking the towers gives players a 10-second Cascading Latent Defect or Latent Performance Defect debuffs, and the Bug debuffs <b>must expire before</b> the Defects do, or the raid wipes.</p><p>If you passed/picked up the Bugs too late, they will not expire in time to cleanse the Defects before they explode and wipe the raid.</p></td></tr>
