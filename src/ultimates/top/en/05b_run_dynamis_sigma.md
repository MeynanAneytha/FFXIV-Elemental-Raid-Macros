# Run: Dynamis (Sigma Version)

Run: Dynamis (Sigma Version) can be broken down into three parts:

1. [Wave Cannons and Lasers](#1-wave-cannons-and-lasers)
2. [Mid/Remote Glitch and knockback towers](#2-knockback-towers)
3. [Hello, World](#3-hello-world-sigma)

## 1. Wave Cannons and Lasers

      <ul>
        <li><b>Top:</b> 〇 × △ □ <b>:Bottom</b></li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>(All tethers should be horizontal)</em></p><p>This establishes where "North" will be for this first part of the mechanic.</p></td>

  <tr>
    <td><p><b>2.</b> Six random players get marked, with each tether pair getting at least one marker.</p>

## 2. Knockback Towers

The next step are the towers with Mid/Remote Glitch.

There are several strategies to deal with this, but we have chosen to go with a strategy that assigns players to towers based on the waymarks they were standing at at the end of the previous section.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><p><b>5.</b> Towers will spawn along the edge of the arena.</p><ul><li>If players have <b>Remote Glitch</b>, five towers will spawn.</li><li>If players have <b>Mid Glitch</b>, six towers will spawn.</li></ul><p>The towers will spawn in a fixed formation, oriented either to where Omega-M was standing before, or directly opposite.</p><p><b>Identify your tower.</b></p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_sigma_waymark_01a.jpg"></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_sigma_waymark_01b.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><p><b>7.</b> Move towards the center, and position yourself in front of your tower.</p><p>Omega-F then appears in the center of the arena, and knocks back all players towards the edge.</p><p>Stand either in the center of the towers (if Mid Glitch), or at the edge of the towers (if Remote Glitch).</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## 3. Hello, World (Sigma)

From here, we finally reach the last part of Run, Dynamis: Sigma which is the part where we resolve Hello, World.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>7.</b> Omega-F will spawn at any cardinal or intercardinal position, with two Right Arm Units opposite, and Omega's Rear Power Unit in the center.</p><p>Use Omega-F as North, and note whether Omega-F is in her blade-legs stance or not.</p>
    <p>Identify three players to go to Omega-F with the following priority:</p>
    <p style="text-align:center"><b>Omega-F:</b> H1 MT ST D1 D2 D3 D4 H2 <b>:Opposite</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>At least two of these players must have one stack of Dynamis each.</li>
      <li>None of these players can have a Hello, World debuff.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The remaining five players go opposite Omega-F.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The two players with Hello, World debuffs stand a little towards the center of the arena to separate themselves from the remaining three.</li>
      <li>The remaining three players briefly line up along the edge
        <ul>
          <li>The two players in front will follow the Hello, Near World player.</li>
          <li>The player at the back will stay behind with the Hello, Distant World player.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_sigma_07.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>8.</b> The Rear Power Unit will start firing a straight-line AoE while slowly rotating.</p>Depending on whether Omega-F has her blade-legs or not, either wait and stay outside <b>or</b> follow the Rear Power Unit's AoE.<p></p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_sigma_08b.jpg"><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_sigma_08a.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>9.</b> After rotating and firing fourteen times, the Rear Power Unit will fire its last laser in this orientation.</p><p>Use this time to move into position to resolve Hello, World.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_sigma_09.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>10.</b> Hello, World debuffs resolve along with the Right Arm Unit's lasers.</p><ul><li>If there are any tanks with one stack of Dynamis that started by Omega-F, they should bait the Arm lasers.</li><li>If there is anyone that started by Omega-F that does not have a stack of Dynamis, they must take the center position to receive Hello, Distant World.</li></ul><p>Done correctly:</p><ul><li>Four players will have one stack of Dynamis</li><li>The other four players will have two stacks of Dynamis.</li></ul></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_sigma_10.jpg"></td>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Hello, World (Sigma)]</b> Why the HTDH priority, and why should tanks take the Arm lasers if possible?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>The goal is to avoid a scenario where tanks are the ones taking Beetle Omega's tethers during the last set of Hello, Worlds in Run: Dynamis (Omega Version).</p>
  <p>This is because if a tank ends up taking a tether, the Max HP debuff will wear off, and the tank will need to be topped up for the last set of Solar Ray tankbusters. While doable, it is rather annoying to deal with.</p>
  <p>To ensure a tank will not take a tether at the end of Omega, that player must enter Omega with just one stack of Dynamis, which means they must miss <em>either</em> the Dynamis stack from Delta, <em>or</em> the Dynamis stack from Sigma.</p>
  <p>If a tank is going to Omega-F, that implies that they <em>already</em> have a Dynamis stack from Delta, so we want them to miss getting a Dynamis stack from Sigma (baiting the Arm lasers) to guarantee they will not take the tethers at the end of Omega.</p>
  <p>While you cannot <em>guarantee</em> that a tank will <em>never</em> take the tethers (since a tank can be extremely unlucky and be assigned three Hello, World debuffs), this at least greatly reduces the chance of that happening.</p></td></tr>
