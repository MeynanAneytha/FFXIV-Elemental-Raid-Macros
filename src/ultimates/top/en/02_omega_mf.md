<b>Tip:</b> If tanks use Rampart at the end of the previous phase (when Omega jumps away), Rampart will cover this Solar Ray and be back up in time for the tethers in Limitless Synergy.</div>

After a while, Omega-M and Omega-F will both cast Party Synergy, the first major mechanic of this phase.

Identifying the first set of safe spots will take some practice. Nukemaru has compiled a collection of clips which may help:

## Limitless Synergy

Omega-M and Omega-F will reappear in the middle of the arena.

For some reason, Omega swaps genders here, so the tank who previously had hate on Omega-M will have hate on Omega-F now. Both tanks will need to Provoke their target as the Packet Filter debuff is still on.

After three autoattacks, the two clones will cast Limitless Synergy and the Packet Filter debuffs will drop, so the party can now hit either target.

Omega-F will teleport North and begin casting Laser Shower, which acts as the hard-enrage. Omega-M will teleport to the middle of the arena and shield Omega-F, rendering her invulnerable until Omega-M is defeated.

Meanwhile, five more Omega-M/F clones outside the arena will throw various mechanics at the party to resolve.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Firewall]</b> Should I apply DoTs on the other target before Firewall resolves?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>No. The Firewall effectively only lets you damage either Omega-M <em>or</em> Omega-F, but not both (even certain abilities like Reprisal are blocked).</p><p>If you apply a DoT on the other target before Firewall resolves, it will technically tick, but deals 0 damage.</p></td></tr>
