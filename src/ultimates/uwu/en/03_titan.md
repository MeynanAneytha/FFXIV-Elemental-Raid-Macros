## Waking Titan

Titan is easily the hardest of the three Primals to wake.

After a knockback, Titan will target three random players (excluding the MT) to be trapped in a Granite Gaol.

A boulder will spawn opposite Titan and explode in an AoE. When a Granite Gaol is hit by this AoE, it will explode and leave behind a sludge puddle that slows movement and applies a DoT. This explosion will also trigger any other Granite Gaols hit.

Thus, the idea is to chain the three gaoled players between Titan and the opposite rock, resulting in a chain explosion that will put a sludge puddle in contact with Titan.

**Titan gains a stack of "Aetherically Charged" for each DoT tick applied by this sludge puddle.**

The following mechanics will also change when Titan is woken:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Normal</th>
    <th>Woken</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Landslide</td>
    <td>Five straight-line AoEs.</td>
    <td>Five straight-line AoEs, <b>followed by a second set of five straight-line AoEs that bisect the first set</b>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Weight of the Land</td>
    <td>Two sets of baited AoEs under random players.</td>
    <td><p>Three sets</p> of baited AoEs under random players.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The **MT** will take hate at the start of the fight.

When a woken Titan is defeated, it will also leave behind a light puddle that will give a player the "Beyond Limits" buff.

<table>
  <tr><td><b>Beyond Limits (Titan)</b></td><td>Melee</td></tr>
</table>

## Ultima Transition

At this point, a healer, a caster, and a melee should have the Beyond Limits buff.

When a player with the Beyond Limits uses an LB3, the buff will be consumed and the LB3 will be replenished. This lets the party LB3 four times in a row:

1. Caster
2. Healer
3. Melee
4. Tank

Start the Caster LB as soon as the Magitek Bits land (and the party takes impact damage). All other LBs can be used as soon as the LB3 bar replenishes.
