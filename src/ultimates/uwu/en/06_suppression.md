# Ultimate Suppression

## Pre-Suppression

Unlike the other phases in this fight, you can push Ultima into Ultimate Suppression early- Ultimate Suppression will start when Ultima Weapon goes **under 50% HP**.

Note that you **must** have a Tank LB3 when Ultimate Suppression ends- if you haven't built enough LB by this time, you may want to consider holding DPS to buy more time.

The important part of this phase, **especially** if DPS has been low is to shield the Vulcan Bursts to prevent them from knocking players out of the arena.

## Ultimate Suppression

This phase is pushed when Ultima Weapon's HP drops below 50%.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Feather Lance]</b> What causes the feathers to converge in on the party?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>This is actually a Woken Garuda mechanic that you can see in P1 if you cleanse <em>three sets</em> of Thermal Low stacks during the Spiny Plume's bubble instead of two.</p><p>The feathers will all home in on party members, killing them- the way to prevent this is to knock them out of the air by cleansing and triggering a Thermal Low (by taking Garuda's tether).</p></td></tr>
