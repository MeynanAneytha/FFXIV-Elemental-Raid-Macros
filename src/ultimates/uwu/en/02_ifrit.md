# Ifrit

## Summary

  <tr><td><b>Infernal Nails</b></td><td>Reverse-Z</td></tr>
  <tr><td><b>Beyond Limits</b></td><td>Caster</td></tr>

## Waking Ifrit

Infernal Nails can be hit by baited Violent Eruptions. When a Nail is hit by an Eruption, it gains a stack (to up two) and increases in size.

Each stack it receives does the following:

* Lowers the damage taken by about 10%.
* Increases the raid-wide damage dealt when the nail is destroyed.

**Ifrit gains a stack of "Aetherically Charged" when an Infernal Nail with two stacks is destroyed.**

The following mechanics will also change when Ifrit is woken:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Normal</th>
    <th>Woken</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Crimson Cyclone</td>
    <td>Straight-line dash, going clockwise.</td>
    <td>Straight-line dash, in the order the Infernal Nails were destroyed in, <b>followed by a cross-shaped AoE 45 degrees to the dash</b>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Flaming Crush</td>
    <td>Split damage.</td>
    <td><p>Split damage that <b>also afflicts a heavy "Accursed Flame" DoT</b> whose duration decreases as more players are hit.</p><p>This should be shared by <b>at least 6 players</b> for minimum impact.</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>

The **ST** will take hate at the start of the fight.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>1.</b> Have the <b>ST</b> tank Ifrit facing south, with the party North.</p><p>Ifrit will open with Hellfire (heavy raid damage), and shortly follow up with a Vulcan Burst.</p><p>Vulcan Burst is a large knockback, (just under half the arena) that can be nullified by Arm's Length/Surecast, or by sufficient shields as the knockback only applies if the player takes damage.</p><p>H2's shields will nullify Vulcan Burst's damage, <b>unless H2 is weakened.</b></p><p>Ifrit will then use three Incinerates in a row. Incinerate is a conal tankbuster that also applies a Fire Resistance Down debuff on anyone hit.</p><ul><li><b>ST:</b> Invuln all three Incinerates.</p></li></ul><p><em>(The "proper way" to do this would be to tank swap twice, once between each Incinerate)</em>.</p><p>Once all three Incinerates are done, the MT Provokes and takes over.</p></td>

## Infernal Nails

This is Ifrit's major mechanic, and where we will wake Ifrit.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>2.</b> Four Infernal Nails will spawn in a trapezium formation, in a <b>random</b> orientation.</p><p>Ifrit will also target one <b>random healer</b> and apply a Searing Wind debuff on that healer.</p><p>Take up positions as follows:</p><ul><li><b>MT:</b> Bring Ifrit between the two close Nails (the top of the trapezium). <b>Remember where this is.</b></li><li><b>D3/D4:</b> Position yourselves beside the bottom-left and bottom-right Nails, about 135 degrees from the MT.</li><li><b>Healer with Searing Wind:</b> Stand opposite the MT.</li></ul></td>
    <td><img src="../images/ifrit/ifrit_02.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>3.</b> </p>The two furthest players from Ifrit (except for the Searing Wind) will bait two sets of four Violent Eruptions. These should be D3 and D4.<p><ul><li><p><b>D3/D4:</b> Bait Violent Eruptions. The first two Eruptions should hit the bottom-left/right Infernal Nail.</p><p>The last two Eruptions should hit the top two Infernal Nails. <em>(This gives some backup in case one player is slow and misses the fourth Nail.)</em></p></li></ul></p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/ifrit/ifrit_03.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>4.</b> When an Infernal Nail gets hit by a second Violent Euprtion (gaining two stacks), destroy them.</p><p>The Nails should be destroyed in a "Reverse-Z" order:</p><ol><li>Bottom-right</li><li>Bottom-left</li><li>Top-right</li><li>Top-left</li></ol><p>As the Nails take less damage as they grow in size, it is a good idea to lower their HP (without destroying them) while they are small.</p>When a Nail is destroyed, the party will take raid-wide damage, and momentality take extra damage, so be sure to give time to recover some HP in between.</p><p>One <b>random DPS</b> will also be chained to the ST. This chain lowers damage dealt the longer it stretches, but can be largely ignored.</p><p><b>Remember where the fourth Nail is, as this will be the starting position for dodging Ifrit's dashes later.</b></p></td>
      <td><img src="../images/ifrit/ifrit_04.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Done correctly, Ifrit will get four stacks of Aetherically Charged (one for each Nail), and will wake, exclaiming "The flames hunger for thee, mortal!".

Ifrit will also start glowing **blue** (which will be important later).

## Crimson Cyclone #1

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>5.</b> Ifrit returns with a Hellfire (heavy raid-wide damage).</p><p>After that, Ifrit will then target a <b>random healer</b> with another Searing Wind.</p><p>Have the party take up positions as follows:<ul><li><b>MT:</b> Pull Ifrit to an intercardinal position near where the fourth Nail was.</li><li><b>Healer with Searing Wind:</b> Stand to the bottom-left, away from the party (~135 degrees).</li><li><b>D3/D4:</b> Stand to the bottom-right, away from the party (~135 degrees).</li></ul></p></td>
      <td><img src="../images/ifrit/ifrit_05.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>6.</b> D3 and D4 bait another two sets of Violent Eruptions together in an anti-clockwise direction before joining the party stack.</p><p>The Healer with Searing Wind also rotates anti-clockwise to end up directly opposite the party.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/ifrit/ifrit_06.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>7.</b> Two Ifrit clones spawn at cardinal positions, and dash across the arena.</p><p>These dashes will <em>always</em> happen along the cardinal directions.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/ifrit/ifrit_07.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>8.</b> Ifrit will then target the other healer with yet another Searing Wind.</p><ul><li><b>The healer with the first Searing Wind:</b> Rotate back clockwise to end up bottom-left of the party (~135 degrees)</li><li><b>The healer with the new Searing Wind:</b> Move to the bottom-right, away from the party (~135 degrees)</li></ul><p>Ifrit will also target a random player with a Woken Flaming Crush, which should be taken as a 6-man stack.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/ifrit/ifrit_08.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

If the party's DPS is good, you can defeat Ifrit by this point, skipping the second set of Crimson Cyclones.

## Crimson Cyclone #2

Four Ifrits will spawn on the outside of the arena- three of these are clones, but one is the real Ifrit (who will be glowing blue).

This is important, because the real Ifrit (who is awake) will have an afterburn that is an untelegraphed, X-shaped AoE 45 degrees from the original dash.

The four Ifrits will **dash in the same order the Nails were destroyed**.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>9.</b> Move to where the fourth Nail was. The healer with Searing Wind will be diretly opposite the party.</p><p><b>Look for the Ifrit that is glowing blue.</b></p><p>Everybody will run in an anti-clockwise direction to <b>end 90 or 180 degrees from the blue Ifrit</b>.</p><p>The party will <em>always</em> have to move into either one or two dashes to do this.</p><p><em>(In this example, the blue Ifrit is where the fourth Nail was, and the party will be moving twice.)</em></p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/ifrit/ifrit_09.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>10.</b> First Ifrit dash.</p><p>Move into this area right after the dash happens.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/ifrit/ifrit_10.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>11.</b> Second Ifrit dash.</p><p>Move into this area right after the dash <b>if you need to</b>.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/ifrit/ifrit_11.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>12.</b> Third Ifrit dash.</p><p>The party should not need to move at this point.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/ifrit/ifrit_12.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>13.</b> Fourth Ifrit dash.</p><p>The party should not need to move at this point.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/ifrit/ifrit_13.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>14.</b> Since the fourth Ifrit was the real (woken) Ifrit, there will be an afterburn AoE after the dash.</p><p><em>(This step can be layered on top of any of the three previous steps, depending on where the real Ifrit was.)</em></p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/ifrit/ifrit_14.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Wrapping up

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>15.</b> Ifrit will return to the center of the arena.</p><p>The healer with Searing Wind <b>will still have one more pulse</b> before the debuff wears off.</p><ul><li><b>Healer with Searing Wind:</b> Wait for Searing Wind to pulse before rejoining the party.</li><li><b>D3/D4:</b> Position yourselves about 135 degrees away from the MT.</li></ul></td>
    <td><img src="../images/ifrit/ifrit_15.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>16.</b> Ifrit will then Incinerate the MT three times. This is the same tankbuster at the start of this phase.</p><ul><li><b>MT:</b> Invuln all three Incinerates.</p></li></ul></td>
    <td><img src="../images/ifrit/ifrit_16.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>17.</b> The two furthest players from Ifrit (which should be D3 and D4) bait another set of four Violent Eruptions before joining the party for a Flaming Crush.</p><p>After this, Ifrit will jump, become untargetable and enrage (Hellfire).</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/ifrit/ifrit_17.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

When a woken Ifrit is defeated, it will also leave behind a light puddle that will give a player the "Beyond Limits" buff.

<table>
  <tr><td><b>Beyond Limits (Ifrit)</b></td><td>Caster</td></tr>
</table>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>18.</b> Titan will land in the center of the arena, dealing proximity damage (Geocrush) to all players.</p><p>Geocrush actually has a very sharp drop-off in damage, and might as well be considered a very large AoE in the center.</p><p>Stand <b>all the way to the edge</b> to avoid dying to Geocrush.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/ifrit/ifrit_18.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
